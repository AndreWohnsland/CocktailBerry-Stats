        The screen is now a 7-inch touch screen, for better user experience.
        There is also only one power supply, a 12V one for the supply of the pumps.
        The current gets split and converted into a 5V one, which is enough for the RPi to run.
        The pumps are still located above the bottles.
        The machine is mounted on a wooden plate for stability and can be disassembled easily for transport.
