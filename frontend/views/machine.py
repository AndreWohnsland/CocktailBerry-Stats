        This is thanks to the custom CocktailBerry board, which replaces the old relay array.
        With this, less inside build volume is needed, which reduces top diameter from 320 to 240 mm.
        This also reduced needed PLA from ~3 to ~2 kg, and makes production on smaller 3D printers possible.

        A custom PCB (CocktailBerryBoard Slim) was designed to control the pumps.
