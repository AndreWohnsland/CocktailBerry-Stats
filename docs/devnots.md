# Generate new API keys

If you have owner acces to deta, you can run:

```bash
deta auth create-api-key --name "keyname" --desc "Desc for key"
deta auth delete-api-key --name "keyname"
```

to manage the API key creation. Also get further help from `deta help` or the [official docs](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/micros/api_keys).
